## What is this?

I summarized this on Reddit, which is too spot-on that it's a waste not to post this here.

> In October I made a program that plays a 'doot' every 15-30 minutes or so. It
> should've been pretty basic, but it needed to run on a Windows computer
> without admin rights and with hardly anything installed.
>
> I was lazy and had Electron readily installed, so I use that.
>
> I made a 120MB program to play an 8KB audio file every 15-30 minutes. It's on
> Github.
